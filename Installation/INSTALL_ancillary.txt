########## Installation of ancillary tools for the DADA2 nifH pipeline #########

If you wish to use the ancillary tools in ../scripts.ancillary, then you must
make sure that several additional bioinformatics tools are available.  All of
them can be installed using conda (or mamba).  I suggest that you install the
additional packages within your "DADA2_nifH" conda environment (which you
created as described in INSTALL.txt).  To do this you can activate DADA2_nifH:
   conda activate DADA2_nifH
and then install as described below.

You only must install packages that are missing.  For example, your system might
already have BLAST+.  If so then it is not necessary to install an additional
version within DADA2_nifH.  However, you are free to do so.  The conda-installed
BLAST+ will override your system BLAST+ while DADA2_nifH is activated.

For each tool below, the script that launches the tool is shown in parentheses.


** Pre_pipeline **
  EstimateTrimLengths (estimateTrimLengths.R)
      [no additional packages required]

  FastQC (do_fastqc.sh)
      conda install -c bioconda fastqc    # ver 0.12.1 is okay

  CheckReadOrientations (checkReadOrientations.R)
      [no additional packages required]


** Post_pipeline **
  Chimera (check_chimera_denovo.sh)
      conda install -c bioconda vsearch   # ver 2.22.1 is okay

  Contaminants (check_nifH_contaminants.sh)
      conda install -c bioconda blast     # ver 2.14.0 is okay

  CheckNifHLike (classifyNifH.sh)
      [no additional packages required]


** Annotation **
  BlastnARB2017 (blastnARB2017.sh)
      conda install -c bioconda blast           # Same as Contaminants
      
  BlastxGenome879 (blastxGenome879.sh)
      conda install -c bioconda blast           # Same as Contaminants
      
  NifHClustersFrank2016 (assignNifHclustersToNuclSeqs.sh)
      conda install -c conda-forge biopython    # ver 1.81 is okay.  Will get numpy too.


Package versions above are okay (have tested).  More recent versions should be
fine too.  Slightly older versions probably are fine as well.


Note that all ancillary scripts (shown in parentheses) should already be
available from the command line because there are links to them within the 'bin'
directory, and you added 'bin' to your path in step #4 on INSTALL.txt.
