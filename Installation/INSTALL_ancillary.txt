########## Installation of ancillary tools for the DADA2 nifH pipeline #########

If you wish to use the ancillary tools in ../scripts.ancillary, then you must
make sure that several additional bioinformatics tools are available.  All of
them can be installed using conda (or mamba).  I strongly suggest that you
install the additional packages within your "DADA2_nifH" conda environment
(which you created as described in INSTALL.txt).  To do this you can activate
DADA2_nifH:
   (base) % conda activate DADA2_nifH
   (DADA2_nifH) %
and then install as described below.

You only must install packages that are missing.  For example, your system might
already have BLAST+.  If so then it is not necessary to install an additional
version within the DADA2_nifH environment.  However, you are free to do so.  The
conda-installed BLAST+ will override your system BLAST+ while DADA2_nifH is
activated.

For each tool listed below, the script that launches the tool is shown in
parentheses.


** Pre_pipeline **
  EstimateTrimLengths (estimateTrimLengths.R)
      [no additional packages required]

  FastQC (do_fastqc.sh)
   (DADA2_nifH) % conda install -c bioconda fastqc">=0.12.1"

  CheckReadOrientations (checkReadOrientations.R)
      [no additional packages required]


** Post_pipeline **
  Chimera (check_chimera_denovo.sh)
   (DADA2_nifH) % conda install -c bioconda vsearch">=2.22.1"

  Contaminants (check_nifH_contaminants.sh)
   (DADA2_nifH) % conda install -c bioconda blast">=2.14.0"

  CheckNifHLike (classifyNifH.sh)
      [no additional packages required]


** Annotation **
  BlastnARB2017 (blastnARB2017.sh)
   (DADA2_nifH) % conda install -c bioconda blast">=2.14.0"       # Same as Contaminants
      
  BlastxGenome879 (blastxGenome879.sh)
   (DADA2_nifH) % conda install -c bioconda blast">=2.14.0"       # Same as Contaminants
      
  NifHClustersFrank2016 (assignNifHclustersToNuclSeqs.sh)
   (DADA2_nifH) % conda install -c conda-forge biopython">=1.81"  # Will get numpy too.


Package versions shown above are the lowest number with which we have tested.
More recent versions should be okay.  Slightly older versions probably are also
okay.

The following command will check that all required R packages and external tools
are installed for both the pipeline and the ancillary scripts:
   (DADA2_nifH) % check_installation.R ancillary

Note that all ancillary scripts (shown in parentheses) should already be
available from the command line because there are links to them within the 'bin'
directory, and you added 'bin' to your path in step #4 on INSTALL.txt.
