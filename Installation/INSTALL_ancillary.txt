########## Installation of ancillary tools for the DADA2 nifH pipeline #########
################################################################################

If you wish to use the ancillary tools in ../scripts.ancillary, then you must
make sure that several additional bioinformatics tools are available.  All of
them can be installed using conda (or mamba).  I suggest that you install the
additional packages within your "DADA2_nifH" conda environment (which you
created as described in INSTALL.txt).  To do this you can activate DADA2_nifH:
   conda activate DADA2_nifH
and then install as described below.

You only must install packages that are missing.  For example, your system might
already have BLAST+.  If so then it is not necessary to install an additional
version within DADA2_nifH.  However, you are free to do so.  The conda-installed
BLAST+ will override your system BLAST+ while DADA2_nifH is activated.

** Pre_pipeline **
  EstimateTrimLengths:     [no additional packages required]
  FastQC:                  conda install -c bioconda fastqc    # ver 0.12.1 is okay
  CheckReadOrientations:   [no additional packages required]

** Post_pipeline **
  Chimera:                 conda install -c bioconda vsearch   # ver 2.22.1 is okay
  Contaminants:            conda install -c bioconda blast     # ver 2.14.0 is okay
  CheckNifHLike:           [no additional packages required]


Package versions above are okay (have tested).  More recent versions should be
fine too.  Slightly older versions probably are fine as well.
