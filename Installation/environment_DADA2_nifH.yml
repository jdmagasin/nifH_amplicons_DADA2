## This file describes the minimal conda environment for running the DADA2 nifH pipeline (see
## INSTALL.txt).  If you also wish to run ancillary tools, then you must install several additional
## packages (see INSTALL_ancillary.txt).  The pipeline and ancillary tools were developed mainly
## using DADA2 version 1.20.0 (and R v4.1.3).  However, any DADA2 version >=1.20 should be fine,
## including the latest (as of July 15, 2023), v1.28.0 (which requires R >=4.3).
