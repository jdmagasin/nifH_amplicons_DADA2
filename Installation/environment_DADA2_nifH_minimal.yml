## This file describes the minimal conda environment DADA2_nifH for running the DADA2 nifH pipeline.
## If you also wish to use ancillary scripts included with the pipeline, then you should instead use
## environment_DADA2_nifH_with_ancillary.yml.  Please see INSTALL.txt.
##
## The pipeline and ancillary tools were developed mainly using DADA2 version 1.20.0 (and R v4.1.3).
## The package verions below were used when creating the nifH ASV database described in Morando and
## Magasin et al., 2024 in Earth System Science Data.
