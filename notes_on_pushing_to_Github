## Mainly follow: https://gist.github.com/mindplace/b4b094157d7a3be6afd2c96370d39fad to
## create a **public** repository called nifH_amplicons_DADA2.
##  -- No Readme, and no license, because you want a totally empty repo or git (command
##     line) will fatal error b/c there are independent histories.
##  -- Also, use my private access token (which expires Feb 18).  This avoids an authentication
##     failure.  (Even though I'm prompted for my username and password.)
git remote add origin https://<ACCESSTOKENHERE>@github.com/jdmagasin/nifH_amplicons_DADA2.git
## Check that it's there
git remote -v
## If you screw up:  git remote remove origin
## Next line, use 'master' rather than 'main' b/c in Settings I changed the default branch name.
git branch -M master
git push -u origin master

## Now change the status to private (goto Settings).
## Locally add a LICENSE (copied GPL v3 text from another repo).

## Now push to GitHub to make sure I can post-privatizing.
git pull origin master     # to be safe
git push -u origin master  # success!


NOTES:
* First creating a private repository (with a Readme and license) led to
  failures b/c of different history compared to my local repo.
* Authentication is wonky.  I created a 30-day private token at GitHub and with
  some trial and error got the proper syntax above.

Kendra's Arctic files, though deleted, are in GitHub (revision #1).  Looks like
a simple way to prevent them and other files from being public, even though they
exist in the local repo, is to use a .gitignore.  Just created that and added
the Arctic fastq dir as well as a few other things.

Deleted the nifH_amplicons_DADA2 from GitHub.  Fingers crossed that recreating
it will prevent the FASTQs from being uploaded.  (Let's see if this time I do
not get the note about uploading large binaries...)

Follow steps above to recreate nifH_amplicons_DADA2.  'origin' is still correct
even though this is a totally new (but same named) repo so will not redo the
'git remote add <URL>' step.

Had to delete / recreate the repo a bunch of times b/c a deleted miniconda
(~60MB) was in the history and giving the full path in .gitignore did not work.
Then authentication problems started so I made a new token.


git remote add origin https://<ACCESSTOKENHERE>@github.com/jdmagasin/nifH_amplicons_DADA2.git
git remote -v
git branch -M master
git push -u origin master



FIXME:
1. Remove KTK's Arctic fastqs before making the repo public!
2. Change to Creative Commons License, most likely.
