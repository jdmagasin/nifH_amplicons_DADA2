To run the example:
    ../classifyNifH.sh nifH_asvs.fasta

The sequences in the fasta will be classified as nifH or not (or unsure) based
on the relative strengths of their best hits to positive versus negative
examples of NifH proteins. The positive and negative examples are taken from a
run of ARBitrator in May 2020. Positive/negative are from ARBitrator's
"specificity phase" where it classifies, with extremely low false positive and
false negative rates (based on the publication), thousands of NifH-like sequences
at NCBI. (Heller et al. 2014)

Outputs:
  posHits.tab    - top 10 blastx hits to the positive NifH examples
  negHits.tab    - top 10 blastx hits to the negative NifH examples
  positives.ids  - subset of the ASVs for which the best positive hit was >10X
                   better than the best negative hit. (E-value was 10x smaller.)
  negatives.ids  - analogous but the negative hit was 10X better
  unsure.ids     - no clearly better positive or negative hit for these sequences
