The following will run uchime3_denovo on nifH ASVs identified by our DADA2
pipeline in amplicon data from Shiozaki et al. 2018 (Chukchi Sea).  No chimera
will be detected.

../scripts/check_chimera_denovo.sh asvs.noChimera.Shiozaki2018.tsv asvs.noChimera.Shiozaki2018.fasta

If the above fails, then perhaps you have not installed vsearch and the R
ShortRead package, described briefly if you run check_chimera_denovo.sh with no
arguments.
