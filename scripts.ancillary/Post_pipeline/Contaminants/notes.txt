Some notes below on how I gathered confirmed contaminant nifH sequences.  My "database" is not
complete!!  Several of the papers below mention more contaminant sequences than I can find in the
papers/suppmats/NCBI.  But some of the papers report on reagent / primer contaminants from years
ago.  Who knows if the suppliers have the same contaminants, or the labs themselves, ... Negative
controls for the particular study really will be key for identifying contaminants (as Hanna has done
in her several papers below).


In Hanna's 2011 PLOS ONE paper:
   Nitrogenase Gene Amplicons from Global Marine Surface Waters Are Dominated by Genes of
   Non-Cyanobacteria

She removed nifH contaminants:

  sequences of >96% amino acid identity (determined using NCBI Blast) to putative contam- inant nifH
  sequences from this study and all known previous reports [21–25] were removed from the dataset.

with contaminants in "this study" based on negative controls (amplified samples that had no DNA
extracts), and 21-25 the 5 papers below (which report contaminants in PCR reagents and primers, at
least):

           nifH-like DNA into commercial PCR primers. FEMS Microbiol Lett 246: 33–38

Let's gather the contaminants reported in these works in fastas under Data.

1. goto2005.fasta: Gathered from NCBI the 9 contaminant sequences in Fig 2.  But dropped
   AY225105–AY225107 because they are in zehr2003.fasta.

2. zehr2003.fasta: Paper says "The amplification products were cloned and sequenced. Sequences have
   been submitted to GenBank® under acces- sion nos.  AY225105–AY225107 and AY333089–AY33310."  The
   second range final value probably should be AY333100, but this range is all 16S anyway.

3. Bostrom: Cannot find the contaminant nifH sequences. No mention of upload. NCBI only has one
   sequence from the paper: DQ291144

4. farnelid2009.fasta: There is not enough information in the paper / suppmats to get the
   contaminant sequences (aka "negative control" b/c amplified from samples w/o template) fromthe
   443 at NCBI.  Fig S1 shows a few emboldened neg ctrls which are in farnelid2009.fasta.  However,
   Fig. S1 is only for group 1 so I can't use it in combination with Table S1 to infer the 43
   negative control sequences.  The main text also mentions these contaminant sequences:
      bal19mayC48, bal30junG27 and bal30junG60
   The latter two I think should be 'jul' since no 'jun' versions exist.  All three sequences are in
   farnelid2009.fasta.  Also added balntcK9 based on next note.

5. XXX farnelid2010.fasta: The 10 negative control sequences are not given in the paper.  They have
   a shared node in Fig. 3. No suppmats to track them down in. All I can determine is a previously
   seen contaminant with accession EU916706 which happens to be balntcK9 from #4, so I added it to
   farnelid2009.fasta.


Also get 8 contaminants mentioned in Turk et al 2011:
   https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2010205/figures/1
Use just the confirmed contaminants which are asterisk'ed (as well as underlined) in Fig. 1.
(Kendra's tree draws from the 5 studies above but only EU916368.1 is in her tree and in my .fasta.)

Do not use the suspected (underlined but not asterisk'ed) sequences:
   In the 2011 PLOS ONE paper, Hanna uses 96%aid to search for contaminants.  Kendra's tree
   underlines suspected contaminants, some of which are >96%aid to ASVs found in the prelim analysis
   for Mo's OSM abstract, including a P.stutzieri-like ASV (AUID.2) that is 100%id to this one in
   Kendra's tree:
     AF117978.1 Pseudomonas stutzeri CMT.9.A NifH (nifH) gene, partial cds
   The ASV was observed in nearly all studies, and happens to be identical to GU196945 which Hanna
   reported as an NCD epibiont to the dinoflagellate Ornithocerus magnificus.  I don't want our
   contaminant filters to throw out this or other potentially interesting stuff.  Better to check
   ASVs like that manually when they draw attention during the analysis.


To make a tiny DB with contaminant nifH protein sequences, go into
Development/NifHContaminantDB and run make_nifHContamDB.sh.

Test/test.sh does a simple search of the ASVs from Mo's 2021 OSM abstract against the contaminants
DB.
