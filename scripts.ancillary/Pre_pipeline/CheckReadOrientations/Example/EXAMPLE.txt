The following command will run checkReadOrientations.R on a tiny set of reads extracted from a North
Pacific nifH data set from Shiozaki, including 4 backwards reads in the R1 and 3 in the R2.
Specifically:
  -- In an R1 FASTQ we expect the forward nifH primer (5'-TGYGAYCCNAARGCNGA-3') in its 5' to 3'
     direction.  If instead we see the reverse nifH primer (5'-ADNGCCATCATYTCNCC-3') in its 5' to 3'
     direction, then we reverse complement the read (and reverse the order of the quality scores).
  -- Similarly for the R2 FASTQ but expect the reverse primer and flip if instead the forward is
     detected.
